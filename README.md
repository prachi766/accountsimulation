This simple command-line banking simulation is a complete program written in Java, designed to demonstrate fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as creating a new account with a unique ID, depositing funds, withdrawing money with overdraft protection, and viewing account details. The program's architecture showcases key concepts like encapsulation within the `Account` class and a clear separation of concerns by dividing logic among three files: `Account.java` (for individual account data), `Bank.java` (for managing all accounts), and `BankingApp.java` (for the user interface). To run it, save all three files in the same directory, compile them using a JDK with the command `javac *.java`, and then execute the program with `java BankingApp`.
